<h3 id="python-developer---complyadvantage">Python Developer - ComplyAdvantage</h3>
<p><em>London - January 2017 - September 2017</em></p>
<p>As a Python developer, I worked on the design and development of distributed and fault tolerant microservices, while also building carefully designed APIs. Due to the size of the datasets used at ComplyAdvantage I payed careful attention to performance and achieved a number of notable performance gains.</p>
<p>While at ComplyAdvantage I lead the development of a new JSON-API compliant REST API, that unified two separate APIs, while paying careful attention to permissions granularity and performance. I also refactored existing code, such as moving a Tornado API to Flask and, optimising and replacing raw SQL with SQLAlchemy.</p>
<p>I also had a customer facing role where I was responsible for the import, export and migration of customer data. To handle the increasing volume I wrote set of tools that leveraged Pandas, Numpy, S3, SQS and Lambda, which enabled the customer success team to take over the much of the process.</p>
<h3 id="contract---full-stack-developer-lystable">Contract - Full Stack Developer, Lystable</h3>
<p><em>London - June 2016 - December 2016</em></p>
<p>With Lystable, I have primarily been a back end developer with a focus on improving infrastructure of the backend, as well as the features that which requires full stack development. I worked on features such as:a webhook framework; audit logging systems; notification behaviors; database analytics; as well as third party integrations.</p>
<p>The primary technologies used were, Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, and a messaging framework built on top of rabbit called Nameko. I introduced the use of Postgres' asynchronous <code>NOTIFY</code> capability log changes to the database in a fault tolerant and scalable manner. I have also worked on creating a location aware search, leveraging OpenStreet Maps and ElasticSearch.</p>
<p>While my primary role at Lystable was the backend, I also worked on React.JS applications adding smaller features like integrations to third party services, and updates to how the application consumes our API.</p>
<h3 id="contract---full-stack-developer-bought-by-many">Contract - Full Stack Developer, Bought By Many</h3>
<p><em>November 2015 - June 2016</em></p>
<p>As a full stack developer for Bought By Many I worked in agile teams on consumer facing Django websites such as ExoticDirect.com and BoughtByMany.com; Flask based micro-services; and frontend SaaS applications.</p>
<p>I worked on everything from simple front end components written in CoffeeScript and SASS, to more complex realtime websocket powered user-interfaces. While work on Bought By Many’s Python based microservices involved adding new features, such as: new endpoints; analytical Mongo aggregations; and API integrations with third parties and our own services, to several large Flask applications.</p>
<p>I created a new frontend SaaS application to replace the one written in Backbone.JS. This application served as a frontend to Bought By Many’s micro services; which needed a tool to visualize data and administrate aspects of the business. I rewrote the app in modern ES6; using RxJS (a functional JS library) as the primary library, while using D3.js for data visualisations. The build depended on PostCSS and Babel, and jQuery Globalize for internationalization (I18N).</p>
<h3 id="full-stack-developer-seven-stones---total-health">Full Stack Developer, Seven Stones - Total Health</h3>
<p><em>January 2015 - October 2015</em></p>
<p>As a full stack web developer for Seven Stones Total Health, I worked on data driven static sites, used to market pharmaceuticals, and iOS applications which ranged from maintaining e-Details (interactive displays targeted for trade fairs and conferences) to internal projects which were part of the company’s wider strategy.</p>
<p>Maintenance of the e-Details involved iterating existing Ember.js Cordova applications to work on later iOS platforms. I was also tasked with building an internal iOS project which relied heavily on presentation and video, a technical challenge I faced was the requirement that HLS video steams be available offline, which I successfully solved using Apple’s Swift to implement an intelligent proxy cache embedded in the app. New projects were done with a combination of native languages and React Native.</p>
<p>I also worked on building responsive static sites based on look-and-feel designs, with responsive data visualisations using D3.js.</p>
<h3 id="contract---web-developer-ks-agency-london">Contract - Web Developer, KS Agency London</h3>
<p><em>October 2014 - January 2015</em></p>
<p>Worked for KS Agency implementing designs and ideas from the designers. This mostly involved implementing designs from Photoshop, and effectively communicating the sites' behaviour.</p>
<p>I created clean and responsive websites with semantic HTML, and clean preprocessed CSS, which degraded gracefully in older browsers. I also created a number of simple web applications within Drupal (PHP) for advanced searching of content and data.</p>
<p>While I was there, I expanded the tool chain by introducing Git, SASS and Amazon Web Services, allowing for smoother deployment.</p>
<h3 id="ios-developer-business-finance-magazine-dublin">iOS Developer, Business &amp; Finance Magazine (Dublin)</h3>
<p><em>December 2012 - May 2013</em></p>
<p>As a freelancer I designed and built an iOS app for Business &amp; Magazine (and accompanying CMS) for readers to read their monthly magazine (before everything went responsive).</p>
<p>I worked to communicate with people at Business &amp; Magazine to maintain their visual style on mobile; and to implement as their request a, ‘pay per issue system’.</p>
<p>For this I created a CMS for the app written in Django with a basic administration interface, which provided an API for the delivery content, and registration of in app purchases which were used to drive the pay per issue system.</p>
<h3 id="intern-canonical-ltd.">Intern, Canonical Ltd.</h3>
<p><em>February 2011 - March 2011</em> As an intern at Canonical I worked on the Ubiquity Desktop Installer, which is the graphical installer used on the Ubuntu series of operating systems.</p>
<p>The desktop installer when I began was primarily written in Python 2, under guidance I helped port some of the installer to Python 3.</p>
<p>The installer also needed a style update (in line with the rest of the OS). I was introduced to the ‘QT’ framework which uses CSS for styling the UI; I was responsible for updating some of the UI under the guidance of a graphic designer.</p>

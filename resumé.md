# Resumé

I’m a developer from Ireland who focuses on full stack web development. I have
worked with technologies from Drupal to Django, and languages from Python to
PHP. I enjoy good design, and take a keen interest of the challenges of using
technology as an effective tool to communicate. In my spare time enjoy studying
computer science, reading interesting books, and as much sport I can reasonably
do.

## Experience

### Contract - Full Stack Developer, Lystable 
*London - June 2016 - Present*

With Lystable, I have primarily been a back end developer with a focus on
improving infrastructure, as well as the occasional feature which requires full
stack development.  During my time at Lystable I have created a comprehensive
audit logging system, 

### Contract - Full Stack Developer, Bought By Many
*November 2015 - June 2016*

As a full stack developer for Bought By Many I worked in Agile teams on both
consumer facing websites such as ExoticDirect.com and BoughtByMany.com;
micro-services; and frontend SaaS applications. 

I worked on everything from simple front end components written in CoffeeScript
and SASS, to more complex realtime websocket powered user-interfaces. While work
on Bought By Many’s micro services involved adding new features, such as: new
endpoint; analytical Mongo aggregations; and API integrations with third parties
and our own services, to several large Flask applications.

I created a new frontend SaaS application to replace the one written in
Backbone.JS. This application served as a frontend to Bought By Many’s micro
services; which needed a tool to visualize data and administrate aspects of the
business. I rewrote the app in modern ES6; using RxJS (a functional JS library)
as the primary library, while using D3.js for data visualisations. The build
depended on PostCSS and Babel, and jQuery Globalize (for I18N).

### Full Stack Developer, Seven Stones - Total Health
*January 2015 - October 2015*

As a full stack web developer for Seven Stones Total Health, I worked on data
driven static sites, used to market pharmaceuticals, and iOS applications which
ranged from maintaining e-Details (interactive displays targeted for trade fairs
and conferences) to internal projects which were part of the company’s wider
strategy.

Maintenance of the e-Details involved iterating existing Ember.js Cordova
applications to work on later iOS platforms. I was also tasked with building an
internal iOS project which relied heavily on presentation and video, a technical
challenge I faced was the requirement that HLS video steams be available
offline, which I successfully solved using Apple’s Swift to implement an
intelligent proxy cache embedded in the app. New projects were done with a
combination of native languages and React Native.

I also worked on building responsive static sites based on look-and-feel
designs, with responsive data visualisations using D3.js.

### Contract - Web Developer, KS Agency London
*October 2014 - January 2015*

Worked for KS Agency implementing designs and ideas from the designers. This
mostly involved implementing designs from Photoshop, and effectively
communicating the sites' behaviour.

I created clean and responsive websites with semantic HTML, and clean
preprocessed CSS, which degraded gracefully in older browsers. I also created a
number of simple web applications within Drupal for advanced searching of
content and data.

While I was there, I expanded the tool chain by introducing Git, SASS and Amazon
Web Services, allowing for smoother deployment.

### iOS Developer, Business & Finance Magazine (Dublin)
*December 2012 - May 2013*

As a freelancer I designed and built an iOS app for Business & Magazine (and
accompanying CMS) for readers to read their monthly magazine (before everything
went responsive).

I worked to communicate with people at Business & Magazine to maintain their
visual style on mobile; and to implement as their request a, ‘pay per issue
system’.

For this I created a CMS for the app written in Django with a basic
administration interface, which provided an API for the delivery content, and
registration of in app purchases which were used to drive the pay per issue
system.
	
### Intern, Canonical Ltd. 
*February 2011 - March 2011*
As an intern at Canonical I worked on the Ubiquity Desktop Installer, which
is the graphical installer used on the Ubuntu series of operating systems.

The desktop installer when I began was primarily written in Python 2, under
guidance I helped port some of the installer to Python 3.

The installer also needed a style update (in line with the rest of the OS). I
was introduced to the ‘QT’ framework which uses CSS for styling the UI; I was
responsible for updating some of the UI under the guidance of a graphic
designer.
